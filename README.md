In this study, we are going to explore the important factors for the cost of real estate, and we want to create a model that can predict the price of the property based on its neighborhood, property type, location, availability, and review. That prediction can help the company suggest the property for rent to someone who is listing their property for the first time. We will implement supervised machine learning models to predict the price of the property. We intend to use multiple linear regression models, decision trees, and support vector regression. We are also going to perform a feature selection that will help us identify the importance of variables in the data for price prediction.
